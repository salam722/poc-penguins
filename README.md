# BoardGames through the Ages

`BoardGames Through the Ages` is a Proof of Concept (PoC project made by Team Penguin for Daugherty University. <br />
Team Penguin comprises of a Business Analtyics and a Data Engineering student.

Selected a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek) for our PoC project.
### What we would like to accomplish?
  1. Introduce the board games from years BCE. 
  2. Ratings of earliest board games
  3. All time favorite categories and board games.

### This PoC includes:
- A data profile
- A Concept model from LucidCharts
- The Data Definition Language (DDL) used to create the tables in an RDBMS (Postgres)
- A notebook detailing how to clean, transform, and load into the RDBMS
- Visualizations using PowerBI.

# DDL

The Data Definition Language (DDL) was written inside of the notebook to create the tables required for the loading of the data. 
First,

# Notebook

This monstrous dataset Team Penguin came across was the ultimate repository for boardgames throughout human history. Tens of thousands of rows that included ranks, categories, recommended timeframe and user age, ratings, and expansive columns that described each board game and the year it was published. From how this dataset is being described, you can probably guess that there was just an overwhelming load of information. A lot we didn't need in order to portray our goal as a team. We wanted to deliver a complete and fully saturated file of thousands of games without running into blank spaces and disingenuous information. 

We started with more than 29 thousand rows.
